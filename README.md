# Projects-From-Colt_Steele-Course
Some beginner projects that I made(coded along) while doing the Web Delevlopment Course by Colt Steele On Udemy
These include simple HTML and CSS projects like a photo blog or a more css oriented project like Candy Museum
Some projects also include Javascript like a simple score keeper and a TV search app that makes use of an API to display the pictures of tv shows you search
